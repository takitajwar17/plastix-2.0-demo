Please provide a brief summary of your big idea, including its primary goals and objectives. Explain what specific issues it aims to address and outline how it will contribute to the efforts of reducing plastic pollution and mitigating its harmful effects on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

Plastix 2.0 is an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application that combines cutting-edge technology with behavioral science to address plastic pollution in Bangladesh's waterways. Our solution empowers citizens to visualize, track, and reduce plastic waste while contributing to a nationwide pollution monitoring system.
Bangladesh faces a severe plastic crisis, with the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system transporting up to 3.8 million tons of plastic to the Bay of Bengal annually. This pollution devastates marine ecosystems, threatens 1.4 million fishermen's livelihoods, and impacts 500,000 tourism workers. However, a significant gap exists between awareness and action, most citizens lack the tools to understand their plastic footprint and make sustainable choices.
Plastix 2.0 bridges this gap through four integrated components:
AR Eco Lens: Creates emotional connection by visualizing environments without plastic pollution. Our ML algorithm identifies 95% of common plastic waste types and quantifies environmental impact in real-time.


Smart Scanner: Empowers consumers to make informed choices by instantly rating products' plastic footprint and suggesting eco-friendly alternatives. Testing shows this feature alone reduced plastic consumption by 27%.


Citizen Science Map: Establishes Bangladesh's first crowdsourced pollution mapping system, documenting 5,000+ hotspots annually to guide targeted cleanup and prevention efforts.


Eco Journey: Implements gamification principles that drive a 30% reduction in single-use plastic through community challenges, rewards, and competition.
Our solution's objectives include:
Reducing plastic waste by 240 tons annually through behavior change
Creating Bangladesh's first comprehensive plastic pollution database
Connecting 100,000 consumers with 250+ sustainable businesses
Improving working conditions for 15,000 waste collectors
Generating $1.5 million in revenue for sustainable alternatives (businesses)
With our team's diverse expertise in AR development, product management, UI/UX design, database engineering, and environmental business models, Plastix 2.0 delivers a technologically sophisticated yet accessible solution. The platform is optimized for Bangladesh's infrastructure challenges, including low-bandwidth environments and varying device capabilities.
Beyond environmental impact, Plastix 2.0 creates economic opportunities through its marketplace of sustainable alternatives and data insights for policymakers. Our solution addresses four of the UN Sustainable Development Goals while aligning with Bangladesh's national environmental policies and international commitments.

Cost-Effectiveness and Financial Viability
Plastix 2.0 demonstrates strong financial viability through several key factors:
Low Per-User Cost: At full capacity (100,000 users), our technical infrastructure costs amount to just $0.12 per user annually, significantly below industry standards for similar applications.


Multi-Revenue Stream Model: The application is designed with three revenue streams to ensure financial sustainability beyond the initial funding period:


Affiliate commissions from eco-friendly product recommendations (8% per sale)
Data licensing to government agencies and researchers ($10,000/region annually)
Premium business features for sustainable businesses ($300-500/month per business)
Positive ROI Projection: With Year 1 costs of $73,000 and projected Year 2 revenue of $424,000, we expect to achieve profitability by month 15, demonstrating a strong return on investment.


Efficient Resource Allocation: 76% of our budget is directly allocated to core product development and growth activities, with only 24% dedicated to operational overhead.


Social Return on Investment: Each dollar invested will yield approximately 3.3 kg of plastic waste reduction through behavioral change and cleanup activities, representing exceptional value for environmental impact.


The budget reflects our commitment to creating a sustainable solution that delivers significant environmental benefits while developing a financially viable business model for long-term operation. Our approach emphasizes cost-efficiency, strategic partnerships, and multiple revenue streams to ensure Plastix 2.0 continues making an impact long after the initial funding period.
